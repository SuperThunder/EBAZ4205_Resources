---JTAG header (J8)---
Top row: (closer to edge) all GND
Bottom row: nc nc TDI TDO TCK TMS Vcc

TCK/TMS/TDO/TDI and pulled up to Vcc by 4.7kOhm, are in series with 22 Ohm to pin

---UART Header (J7)---
Reference: Ethernet to left, SD to right
Vcc Tx Rx GND

Rx is U3.A.16 but MIO 25
Tx is U3.F.15 but MIO 24

note: Can get JTAG printf using 'CoreSight'


---JTAG HS3 adapter---
With notch at Top

TDI x   TMS TDO TCK
x   x   x   Vcc GND



---Notes on using UART to CH340C of VGA+power+serial adapter board---

CH340C is connected through Data2 connector of EBAZ4205
at right side, notch at top:

Rx  GND 12v
Tx  GND 12v

CH340 Rx: DATA2_5 -> G20 -> PS Tx
CH340 Tx: DATA2_6 -> J18 -> PS Rx

Route to EMIO (in PS conf) -> PL (XDC) -> Data2

'Should work with PS UART or by AXI UARTLite'

xdc for RX:
set_property PACKAGE_PIN J18 [get_ports{UART_1_0_rxd}]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports{UART_1_0_rxd}]

xdc for TX:
set_property PACKAGE_PIN G20 [get_ports{UART_1_0_txd}]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports{UART_1_0_txd}]

Make UART1 external!

One Chinese example used UART0 since UART1 is MIO24/25 routed


---Choosing UART in Vitis---
platform.spr -> modify BSP -> overview -> standalone -> stdin / stdout

Can be set to PS UART0, UART1, CoreSight, or none

Note: when using CoreSight, it inexplicably defaults to showing CoreSight for Core 1, not Core 0. 
It will say 'TCF Debug Virtual Terminal - ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore #1' underneath the 'Console' tab.
Switch with the computer screen-ish icon in the upper right of the tab bar.


---Board info---
LEDs:
W13 - Red
W14 - Green
A17 - Button (active high)



---Powering board---
Anything 5v - 12v is probably fine. Couldn't actually identify the voltage regulator for the Zynq/RAM/NAND/ethernet, but it's probably some kind of SMPS putting out 3.3v.
My expansion board uses a DC barrel jack with 5V 2A adapter, which powers the board through the connections on the Data1/2/3 ports. It's also possible to use one of the 4 pin (fan?) headers or the 6pin connector (soldering diodes / short the diode pads possibly required).



---PetaLinux notes---
Best guide here: https://webuiltawallwebuiltthepyramids.blogspot.com/2021/01/ebaz4205-petalinux-installation.html

To add extra packages, use petalinux-config -c rootfs after doing the initial petalinux-config. A surprising amount is available, even Python3 and Gnome.
