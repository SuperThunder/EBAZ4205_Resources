CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): design_1_i/ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0, ENET0_GMII_RX_CLK_0_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): design_1_i/ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0, ENET0_GMII_TX_CLK_0_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
