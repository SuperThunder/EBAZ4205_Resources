# Android based kernel exports the uevent property PARTNAME, which can be
# used to find out at run time the named partitions (e.g. boot) for the
# device. This is specially useful for the Touch based images and flash-kernel,
# to automatically update the kernel by writing at the correct partition
# (independently of the hardware revision).
