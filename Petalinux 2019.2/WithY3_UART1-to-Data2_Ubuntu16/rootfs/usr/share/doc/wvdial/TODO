WvDial
------
- 1ms-lag-mode for wvmodem
- adjust the number of seconds before "hoping for the best" 
	- sometimes the login prompt takes a long time to answer.
- mention /etc/wvdial.conf, /dev/ttyS*, and pap-secrets file permissions
- allow passing of options on the command line:  if it has an '=' sign,
	assume it's a configuration setting. - DONE version 1.5 (01/2002)
- find pppd in PATH, don't assume /usr/sbin/pppd
- blank lines count as prompts (sometimes?)
- create a pidfile in /var/run/wvdial.pid
- split the debian postinst script out, so that non-debian users get the
	convenient setup prompts
- go to background automatically when starting pppd (watch out with the
	lockfile!)
- create config file 0600!!
- if pppd dies "too quickly", suggest to the user that /var/log/ppp.log,
	daemon.log, etc may contain the answers to the problem.
- '@' is a prompt string :)  (MSN)
- try simply "AT" (3 retries) after finding max baud rate, rather than going
	directly to retry the full init string.

WvDial - docs
------
- how to disable call waiting (insert *70, in the phone number)
- split wvdial.1 man page into wvdial.1 and wvdial.conf.5
