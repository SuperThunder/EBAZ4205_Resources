In addition to "apt_pkg" and "apt_inst" (that are thin wrappers around
the c++ libapt code) a new python module "apt" is provided since version
0.6.13 of python-apt.

It is a more python like interface to work with libapt (it uses apt_pkg
internally). Although there are already applications written against the new
apt python interface the API may change in the future and should not be
considered stable. If in doubt, please contact deity@lists.debian.org.

WARNING !!! The API is not 100% stable yet !!!
