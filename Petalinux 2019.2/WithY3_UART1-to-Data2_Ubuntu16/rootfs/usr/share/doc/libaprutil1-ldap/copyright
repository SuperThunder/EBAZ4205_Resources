The source files crypto/apr_md4.c and crypto/apr_md5.c contain code which is
derived from reference code from RFC-1320, and RFC-1321. This code is
copyright RSA Data Security, Inc. ("RSA"). RSA made the following statement
about the conditions of use of this code. Debian chooses to use and
distribute this code according to the conditions outlined in this statement
and NOT according to the license contained in the source files.

  The following was recevied Fenbruary 23,2000 From: "Linn, John" February 19,
  2000
  
  The purpose of this memo is to clarify the status of intellectual
  property rights asserted by RSA Security Inc. ("RSA") in the MD2, MD4 and
  MD5 message-digest algorithms, which are documented in RFC-1319, RFC-1320,
  and RFC-1321 respectively. Implementations of these message-digest
  algorithms, including implementations derived from the reference C code in
  RFC-1319, RFC-1320, and RFC-1321, may be made, used, and sold without
  license from RSA for any purpose. No rights other than the ones explicitly
  set forth above are granted. Further, although RSA grants rights to
  implement certain algorithms as defined by identified RFCs, including
  implementations derived from the reference C code in those RFCs, no right to
  use, copy, sell, or distribute any other implementations of the MD2, MD4, or
  MD5 message-digest algorithms created, implemented, or distributed by RSA is
  hereby granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Parties interested in
  licensing security components and toolkits written by RSA should contact the
  company to discuss receiving a license. All other questions should be
  directed to Margaret K. Seif, General Counsel, RSA Security Inc., 36 Crosby
  Drive, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730.  Implementations of the MD2, MD4, or
  MD5 algorithms may be subject to United States laws and regulations
  controlling the export of technical data, computer software, laboratory
  prototypes and other commodities (including the Arms Export Control Act, as
  amended, and the Export Administration Act of 1970). The transfer of certain
  technical data and commodities may require a license from the cognizant
  agency of the United States Government. RSA neither represents that a
  license shall not be required for a particular implementation nor that, if
  required, one shall be issued.
  
  DISCLAIMER: RSA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, VALIDITY OF INTELLECTUAL
  PROPERTY RIGHTS, ISSUED OR PENDING, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
  DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MD2, MD4, OR
  MD5 ALGORITHMS. NOTHING IN THIS GRANT OF RIGHTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A
  REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY GIVEN BY RSA THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
  ALGORITHM WILL NOT INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD
  PARTY. IN NO EVENT SHALL RSA, ITS TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
  PARENTS AND AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
  ANY KIND RESULTING FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ALGORITHM, INCLUDING ECONOMIC
  DAMAGE OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER RSA
  SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE.
