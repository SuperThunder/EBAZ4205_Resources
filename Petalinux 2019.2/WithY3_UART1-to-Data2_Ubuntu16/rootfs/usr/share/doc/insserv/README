   Install
   =======

Edit the Makefile (set INITDIR to the path of the
boot scripts used by the system during boot time),
type `make' and `make install'.

   Downloading latest version
   ==========================

The latest version of the insserv source is available from
<URL: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/init/ >.

   Processes controlling
   =====================

This small package provides a tool for process controlling
in System V boot scripts.

The syntax is simple:

   insserv

   insserv etc/init.d

   insserv etc/init.d/myscript

See manual page for more information.


Happy booting,

       Werner Fink
