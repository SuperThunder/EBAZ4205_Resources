Eject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape
drive, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control. The
command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the
auto-eject feature supported by some devices, and close the disc tray
of some CD-ROM drives.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to compile and install
the program.

The following devices and configurations are known to work with eject:

Devices:
- 1GB and 2GB SCSI IOMEGA JAZ drives
- Apple PowerMac floppy drive
- HP1534 SCSI DAT tape drive
- IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM
- IDE/ATAPI IOMEGA 100MB ZIP drive
- IDE/ATAPI LS120 120MB floppy drive
- Parallel port IOMEGA 100MB ZIP drive
- SCSI CD-R drive
- SCSI CD-ROM
- SCSI MO Drive
- Sun SPARC floppy drive 
- Fujitsu M2512A magneto-optical disk drive (SCSI)

Kernels:
- 2.0.36 (and earlier 2.0.x)
- 2.1.132 (and earlier 2.1.x)
- 2.2.16 (and earlier 2.2.x)
- 2.4.4 (and earlier 2.4.x)
- 2.6.11 (and earlier 2.6.x)
- with both the IDE, SCSI, and IDE SCSI emulation kernel drivers

Platforms:
- Intel (Red Hat)
- SPARC
- PowerPC
- DEC Alpha

It is loosely based on the SunOS eject command.

If you have any problems or suggestions, drop me a line. I'm
particularly interested in hearing if it does or doesn't work with
media other than CD-ROM or when running Linux on non-Intel machines.

Version 2.0 is mostly a rewrite of version 1.5 to clean up the source
and add a number of new features (and take out some useless ones).
Many thanks to the beta testers for version 2.0:

Andrea Borgia	Darius Davis	David Wheeler	Jochen Stein
