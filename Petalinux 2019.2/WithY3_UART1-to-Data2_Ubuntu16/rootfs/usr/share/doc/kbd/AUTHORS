The programs loadkeys, dumpkeys and showkey were derived from
Risto Kankkunen's kbd-0.81.

The font loading code goes back to the codepage package by
Joel Hoffman (joel@wam.umd.edu). (He tells me that the original
reference is: "From: p. 307 of _Programmer's Guide to PC & PS/2
Video Systems_ by Richard Wilton. 1987.  Microsoft Press".)

The kernel and user interface for the font loading were derived
from Eugene Crosser's intl_con package.

[Similar things were done earlier by
 Jerry Kaidor (tr2!jerry@abekas.com, jkaidor@synoptics.com) : fontpak,
 H. Peter Anvin (hpa@nwu.edu) and Pavel Zaboj (xzaboj@vse.cs).
Their code was not used, but the Latin-1 *.psf fonts were developed
by H. Peter Anvin, and the Latin-2 ones by Pavel Zaboj.]
