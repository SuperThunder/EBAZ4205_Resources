geoip for Debian
----------------

The library comes with a free country database which does not contain all
the information that can be accessible via the GeoIP API. To find other
database editions, please visit http://www.maxmind.com/ (all of them except
for the one included in the package require you to purchase a license from
MaxMind)

If you have obtained the license, you must install the geoip-bin package and
copy the /etc/GeoIP.conf.default file to /etc/GeoIP.conf and edit it entering
the licensing data.


Updating databases
------------------

If you need to update your database very frequency, then you can install
the geoip-database-contrib package.
