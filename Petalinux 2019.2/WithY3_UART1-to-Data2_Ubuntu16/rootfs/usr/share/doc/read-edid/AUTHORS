The lrmi files were written by Josh Vanderhoof.

Matthew Kern (poly-p man) <pyrophobicman@gmail.com> is the current maintainer,
fixed some minor bugs, and rewrote a significant chunk of code for 3.0.0.

John Fremlin <vii@users.sourceforge.net> wrote get-edid and the
original parse-edid. He was the maintainer until 1.4.1.

Dan Hugo <dhugo@reallycool.com> afforded immoral support, resulting in
the 1.3 series.

Martin Kavalec <xkavm04@vse.cz> enhanced parse-edid to display
frequencies and DPMS features. He also added better monitor name
detection and h/vsync type printing.

Branden Robinson <branden@debian.org> wrote the manpage.

If you want to distribute or modify read-edid, please e-mail the
maintainer, Matthew Kern, a courtesy message.
