GnuPG for Debian
================

A comprehensive manual (the GNU Privacy Handbook) is included in the
gnupg-doc package.  It can also be found online at
<http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/guides.html>.

Smart card readers
------------------
If udev, consolekit, and gnupg are installed, then locally logged-in
users will be automatically granted permission to access any detected
USB SmartCard reader devices.

/lib/udev/rules.d/60-gnupg.rules lists the supported devices.  If yours
is not listed there, you can try creating a copy of that file in
/etc/udev/rules.d/ with your deviceâ€™s information.  Wishlist bugs
against the gnupg package about unsupported devices would be welcome.
