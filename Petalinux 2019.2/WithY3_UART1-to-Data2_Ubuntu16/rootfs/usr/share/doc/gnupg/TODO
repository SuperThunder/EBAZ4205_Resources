* Using an expired key for signing should give an error message
  "expired key" and not "unusable key'.  Furthermore the error should
  also be thrown when the default key has expired.  Reported by
  Eric.VanBuggenhaut add AdValvas.be.

* pause scrolling help in --edit-key and elsewhere.

* getkey does not return revoked/expired keys - therefore it is not
  possible to override it.

* Selection using +wordlist does not work.
  What about adding a feature -word to the +wordlist search mode.

* Check the changes to the gpg random gatherer on all W32 platforms.

* Show more info does not work from edit->trust. We should give more
  information on the user ID under question while running
  --update-trustdb.

* Check that no secret temporary results are stored in the result parameter
  of the mpi functions.  We have already done this for mpi-mul.c 

* We need another special packet at the end of a clearsign message to mark
  it's end and allow for multiple signature for one message.  And
  add a real grammar to the code in mainproc.c

* Fix the bug in the mips assembler code

* Add a way to show the fingerprint of an key signator's keys

* Concatenated encryption messages don't work corectly - only the
  first one is processed.

* Add option to put the list of recipients (from the encryption
  layer) into the signatures notation data.

* --disable-asm should still assemble _udiv_qrnnd when needed

* the pubkey encrypt functions should do some sanity checks.

* "gpg filename.tar.gz.asc" should work like --verify (-sab).

* for messages created with "-t", it might make sense to append the
  verification status of the message to the output (i.e. write something to
  the --output file and not only to stderr.  However the problem is
  that we consider the message transpatrent and don't have any
  indication of the used character set.  To implement this feature
  we need to make sure that all output is plain 7 bit ascii but
  given that we need to print a user name, this does not make sense
  at all.  The only way this can be implemented is by assuming that
  the message is encoded in utf8 and hope tht everyone starts to use
  utf8 instead of latin-1 or whatever RSN.  Hmmm, I myself should
  start with this.

* keyflags don't distinguish between {certify,signature}-only.

* cat foo | gpg --sign | gpg --list-packets
  Does not list the signature packet.

* When presenting the result of a verification show the user ID with
  the highest trust level first instead of the primary one.

* allow the use of option in gpg.conf. 

* Add the NEWSIG status.

* Delete a card key as well as a wiping.

* passphrase_to_dek does not return NULL after a cancel.  There is
    no way to issue a cancel when unsing the CLI - this would however
    be a Good Thing when used with mixed symkey/pubkey encrypted
    messages. See comment in mainproc.c:proc_symkey_enc. 
    Note, that this has been fixed in 2.0.2 - we should backport it.

* Backport from GnuPG-2:

	* keyedit.c (menu_select_uid): Use IDX ==-1 t select all.
	(menu_select_key): Ditto.
	(keyedit_menu) <cmdSELKEY, cmdSELUID>: Allow '*' to select all.
