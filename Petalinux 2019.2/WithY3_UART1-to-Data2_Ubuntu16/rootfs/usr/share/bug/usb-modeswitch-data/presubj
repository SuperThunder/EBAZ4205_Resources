Reporting a bug against usb-modeswitch-data
-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-—-

Debian will not ship patches to support devices not supported by
upstream. If you think that your device should be supported by
usb-modeswitch-data, please report it on the upstream forum:

	http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/

Please do so, for two reasons:

a) upstream is nice and responsive: new tarballs appear frequently,
b) a device supported upstream benefits the whole community, not
   only Debian.

Of course, bugs for things going wrong are welcome!
