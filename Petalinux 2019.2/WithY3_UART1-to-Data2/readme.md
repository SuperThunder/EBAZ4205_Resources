# Installation
Copy BOOT.BIN and image.ub to the FAT32 boot partition of the SD card.
Copy the contents of rootfs to the ext4 rootfs partition of the SD card.

# Login
Account is root/root.
By ssh, you will need to enter the password twice (root login is meant to be disallowed, but the feature is bugged and allows login on the second password attempt).
